--- Part one ---

For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value.
The checksum is the sum of all of these differences.

--- Part two ---

find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. 
They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.

--- Part one ---

Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like this:

17  16  15  14  13
18   5   4   3  12
19   6   1   2  11
20   7   8   9  10
21  22  23---> ...

How many steps are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?

Input: 265149

--- Part two ---

As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value 1 in square 1. Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.

What is the first value written that is larger than your puzzle input?

Your puzzle input is still 265149.
